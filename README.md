**An English-> Finnish translator API.** Hosted on Hugging Face.

This API registers your input automatically after ~1 second, and displays a little animation (parrot jumping around) to indicate query is being processed.

Try to write in full sentences, to help the AI with proper context.

The user interface is responsive and optimized for mobile window sizes.
