**An English-> Finnish translator API.** I made this little app as a part of a Metropolia project application process, and also to practice app deployment on Hugging Face.

This API registers your input automatically after ~1 second, and displays a little animation (parrot jumping around) to indicate query is being processed.

The user interface is responsive and optimized for mobile window sizes.
